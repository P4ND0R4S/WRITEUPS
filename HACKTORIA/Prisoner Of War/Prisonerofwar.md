### $\color{#03f6f9}{PROLOGO}$
Raphaël Bernard had always dreamed of becoming a soldier. Growing up in the countryside of France, he had spent his days playing war games with his friends and practicing his marksmanship. So when he turned 18, he knew that there was only one path for him: the French Foreign Legion.

After completing his training, Raphaël was assigned to a task force going into Mali. Where French forces were fighting against insurgent groups. It was a dangerous mission, but Raphaël was ready for the challenge.

During a regular patrol, as their convoy made it’s way through the rugged terrain, the convoy came under attack by a group of heavily armed insurgents. The soldiers fought bravely, but they were outnumbered and outgunned.

Raphaël took cover behind a nearby rock, his rifle at the ready. He could hear the sounds of gunfire and explosions all around him, and he knew that this was a fight to the death.

But despite the chaos and danger, Raphaël remained calm and focused. He picked off the insurgents one by one, his shots hitting their marks with deadly precision.

As the battle raged on, Raphaël’s skills and bravery earned him the respect and admiration of his comrades. He was a true hero, and he would stop at nothing to protect his country and his fellow soldiers.

But unfortunately, Raphaël’s luck eventually ran out. He was hit by a stray bullet and fell to the ground, unconscious. When he woke up, he found himself in the hands of the insurgents, who had taken him prisoner.

Raphaël knew that this was a desperate situation, but he refused to give up hope. He was a soldier, and he had been trained to survive in the toughest of circumstances.

Raphaël was held in a small, dark cell, with no access to the outside world. He was subjected to endless interrogations and torture, but he never broke. He knew that he had to hold out, no matter what.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Raphaël was rescued by a team of French special forces. He was severely injured and malnourished, but he was alive, and that was all that mattered.

As he was whisked away to safety, Raphaël couldn’t help but feel a sense of gratitude and pride. He had survived the worst that the enemy had to throw at him, and he knew that he had come out stronger and more determined than ever before.

### $\color{#03f6f9}{INFORMACION}$
Greetings Special Agent K. We have an urgent contract for the government of France. After their official departure from Mali during August 2022, only a few platoons of Special Operation Units remain in the country. Officially, these troops are not present. Unofficially, they are there to protect high ranking politicians and other French partisans.

Two days ago, during a routine escort of a Malian VIP, the convoy was ambushed by unknown insurgent forces. The VIP and most of the convoy managed to return fire and make it out alive. One of the soldiers however, Raphaël Bernard, was hit in the right leg and taken prisoner by the insurgents.

Not being able to reach private Bernard before being captured, French forces were ordered to stand down and not give chase.

Continuing efforts of the French government to locate the missing private have yielded no results. Up until this morning, when a young girl approached a local police unit. She conveyed to them she had escaped a childrens home where she was kept against her will. The man who helped her escape, gave her a picture of the place they were being held. We have reason to believe this man is the missing private, Raphaël Bernard.

The girl approached the officers on the RN1 near “Posté de contrôle KAYES”. Below you find the image given to the girl, as well as the AOR (Area of Operation) of the remaining French detachement.

It’s your job to locate the building where the French private is being held. Once the location is confirmed, French special forces will conduct a raid to extract Raphaël Bernard.

As always, Special Agent K. The contract is yours, if you choose to accept.
